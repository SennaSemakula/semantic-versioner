# semantic-versioner
## Why?
Using go:generate and go:embed to provide safety checking of build versions over ldflags because latter does not provide a safety system to check for input validation. For example there could be a case where we forget to pass in the version tag but it wonâ€™t fail during compile time. This approach will fail fast as it always expects an artifact to be present.

Build version is available with version const at runtime.

There is a script that generates an artifact version.txt which is ephemeral and should only be generated during the CD pipeline on the fly. It should never be added to upstream version control.

## Running
1. `make gen`

2. `make run`

## Running tests
1. `make test`
